tree && graph

tree operation:
insert node
search node
remove node
copy tree (subtree)
delete tree (subtree)

tree traversal and the use case for different traversal method:
depth-first search: use stack
pre-order: root, left, right
in-order: left, root, right
post-order: left, right, root
breadth-first search: use queue

recursive method
iteratrive method

when to use tree traversal:
pre-order: create a copy of tree. get prefix expression of an expression tree.  (polish notation)
in-order: return nodes in increasing/decreasing order in a BST
post-order: delete subtree from tree. get postfix expression of an expression
tree.



Balanced tree
spanning tree

common terms
binary search tree (BST)
red-black tree
heap (min/max heap)

access cost
maintenance cost
